## About
[Deployed Application](https://rapid-resume.herokuapp.com/)
Rapid Résumé is a website that allows users to sign up for an account and create a resume based on their information tailored to the web development sector. The user can then download a virtual copy of their resume to send out to potential employers or print out a hardcopy for their interviews.

## Description
The techonologies used in this application include react.js, bulma framework, apollo server, graphql, node.js, animation.css, yui framework, mongodb, mongoose, express server, and jspdf. When signing up for an account, the user's credentials are checked through authentication to meet certain requirements. Once logged in, the user may enter in specific information on the resume build pages. Once all info is entered and put into the mongoDB user table, that info is entered into the chosen résumé template. There, the user may print off a copy or download it as a file using the jspdf.
